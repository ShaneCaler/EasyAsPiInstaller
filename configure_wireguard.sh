This option always includes only IP addresses or networks that are available on the remote site.
It's not an IP address/network outside the tunnel (so no configuration from which public IP address
a client is allowed to connect) but only addresses/networks which are transported inside the tunnel!
In a road warrior scenario, where the client does not provide a whole network to the server,
the netmask is always /32 on IPv4 or /128 on IPv6. Packets on the VPN server with this destination
IP addresses are sent to this specified peer. This peer is also only allowed to send packages from
this source IP address to the VPN server. Itâs also important to know that there are no peers
with the same AllowedIPs addresses/networks inside the same configuration file. If this would be the case,
the server would not know to which peer the server has to send packages matching multiple peers with the same network configured."

A primary goal of WireGuard is to be as stealthy and silent as possible. This is overall a good thing,

firewall or NAT (router). Think of WireGuard as being one of those 'lazy texters' that we all 
know and love - generally, WireGuard will only transmit data ($t_bold)after($t_reset) it has received 
a request from a peer. So imagine your lazy friend that only replies once you contact them first. They're
still a good friend and you can still trust them, they just don't like texting so they do it as little
as possible. Okay, maybe not the best analogy, but hopefully you get the overall picture. 
So what does this have to do with PersistentKeepAlive? Well, that setting will tell the peer to send
data known as 'keepalive packets' to the WireGuard server that basically just tells it 
'Hey, I'm here, don't forget about me!' By setting it to 25, we are telling the peer to remind WireGuard
that they are still active every 25 seconds. As WireGuard puts it, you should only need it if you are 
'behind NAT or a firewall and you want to receive incoming connections long after network traffic has 
gone silent, this option will keep the 'connection' open in the eyes of NAT.'"
